# Client prediction implementation campaign

The new human mandate requires local predicted physics, same-frame divergence measurement,
authoritative rollback and bounded canonical resimulation with two real clients and a dedicated server.
The previous presentation-only campaign remains independently closed; its results do not qualify this work.

Ownership: IAS owns protocol, full state, inputs, physics worker and restore; Netcode Sky League owns
gameplay integration, camera/HUD and parent pins. A predicted-client profile must be separate from
PresentationClient; no existing guard is weakened. The server remains authority; each predicted client
has one physical writer for its complete causal world. Start with the full two-car world, not a guessed
single-car island. Predict the opponent only from information actually received, never test schedule knowledge.

The historical divergence helper compares the same frame, world incarnation, branch, authority epoch,
schema and registry generation. It measures position, linear velocity, orientation and angular velocity
for each actor, while also comparing full canonical actor and world payload bytes. Hidden mechanical
or gameplay differences require reconciliation even when visible poses coincide. Diagnostic quaternion
normalization never changes physics. Publication serials are local and are not compared across processes.
History has explicit frame and byte budgets; expiry, future authority, roster changes and malformed state
are distinct outcomes. No fabricated zero-error result is returned for unavailable history.

This helper neither authenticates a sender nor proves payload completeness. Its caller must obtain
local state from the completed native publisher and server state from the authenticated original connection,
with certified complete native serializers. Current native complete-restore providers are absent.
RequestRollbackAndResimulation still rejects live input sessions. No native guard is opened by this tranche.

Next implementation: complete stock-car/subbody/common/contact/world checkpoint providers and boundary
lease; atomic input+world restore; exact retained local inputs and explicitly predicted remote inputs;
bounded Fast catch-up through the same physical pipeline; resimulation receipts and final-only presentation.
No rollback acknowledgement may be issued before the actual restored/replayed publication is observed.
Missing history requires an explicit full resynchronization, not a teleport labelled rollback.

Acceptance needs actual client prediction before server delivery; forced incorrect remote predictions and
collisions; detected historical mismatches; authenticated restore/replay receipts; post-replay equality
of full causal state/contacts/inputs; no duplicated effects; finite natural process drains and exact-source audits.
Loss/delay/reordering trials and human camera/control continuity are separate measured gates.

RemoteRequestPrediction implements bounded hold-last-REQUEST speculation with explicit evidence frame,
not hold-last-applied filtering. Predictions are a distinct type with no counterfeit device sequence,
raw edge or reset. Only earlier received server commands may seed them. Late changed requests and
even within-frame taps with unchanged final values invalidate the affected historical frame. The host
must then restore/replay through the native transaction; the helper cannot acknowledge that operation.
Confirmed data and speculation have finite capacity; no silent eviction of commands needed for correction.

RollbackReplayCoordinator now implements correction ordering and bounded replay through a mandatory
native adapter interface: authenticated origin token, same-frame historical comparison, current target
and replay budget, prepare before mutation, restore/read-back equality, consecutive canonical steps,
history replacement and one final presentation release. Adapter failure after mutation retires the
timeline; there is no partial-world fallback. Portable coordinator tests use an arithmetic world fixture.
No real native adapter/provider is supplied or qualified yet, so this is NOT working client rollback.

The next native candidate adds a production Forward/Resimulation purpose to the canonical frame
context, independent of Shipping/test builds. It leaves frame, fixed delta, physical time and every
restore admission guard unchanged. Existing fixture tags are preserved. Pacing diagnostics consume
the purpose to distinguish unpaced replay from real-time starts. SL external effects may inspect
the same purpose, but physical gameplay must still execute during replay. This tag is not an
authority, ownership, lifetime, world-restore or event-deduplication certificate.


Native storage implementation is advancing separately from that portable coordinator.
RestorableSuspension uses a genuine derived Engine object, owns its configuration,
and serializes every protected spring/smoothing field without calling mutating getters.
RestorableWheel covers all44 native dynamic fields and frozen configuration. Its current
recipe explicitly refuses a nonempty opaque Engine FGraph; it never approximates that
configuration. Staged tokens reject native mutation, wrong targets, repeated commits,
configuration mutation and same-address lifetime replacement. The native fixture also
checks600 subsequent original Engine wheel steps after correction. These are child
providers; none establishes an exclusive world/lifecycle lease or a network admission.

NativeVehicleStorageCheckpoint additionally stages four wheel and four suspension
states and installs them into the original native BASE objects via legal complete
copy assignment, retaining the original configuration pointers. Existing subbody
bindings therefore keep their exact addresses, including after preparation objects
are retired. This fixed recipe refuses other vehicle subsystems rather than omitting
their causal state. Its child commit does not publish an atomic component/world;
whole-world ownership, Common/subbody/contact/input providers and integration remain
required. Fresh native tests on each exact candidate are mandatory; source assertions
and an earlier suspension test do not qualify this new storage participant.


BranchInputFilter adds a separate replayable input-processing domain. Local requests
retain their original immutable V2 Device frame; confirmed remote requests retain
the received packet; speculative holds retain only FSpeculativeRequest. No V2 frame,
Device generation, source sequence, raw reset/edge or transport credit is invented
for a forecast. The same pure authoritative quantized processing function executes
once from the restored Applied baseline toward the held Requested values. Frame
order, immutable local/remote role, contract/policy, horizon, owner thread, revision
and native filter lifetime are checked. Restoring this filter state alone neither
authenticates a server nor restores/adopts a physical world or an active registry.
The new native unit fixture is NOT_RUN until the exact next candidate is built.
